                3. You go into a casino, and it looks just like the casino you
                were in last night. You go to a new casino, and it looks just
                like the one you’ve just walked out of. You ask the bouncer
                for directions, and he always tells you his name is Dave.

                12. The graveyard seems small when you approach it, but I have yet to find the end.
                It seems to keep streaming around me - a grave covered in poker chips, a
                grave emitting wisps of smoke, a grave that is singing, always singing.

            Have you ever wanted to be in the kind of cafe where everyone remembers your name?
            The sort of place that feels like warm arms wrapped around you? Look no further.
            Established in 1932, the Coyote Kettle has the honor of being the very first business
            to open up in what would eventually become the town of Wending Flats. This cafe is an
            important landmark of our town, embedded into our cultural identity. Beyond its historical
            importance, it is a cozy, family-owned cafe that serves as a local favorite and a little
            slice of home for those just passing through. No visit to Wending Flats could be
            considered truly complete without a cup of their famous coffee — often claimed to be the
            very best in the state of Utah. Coyote Kettle is a place so homey and welcoming,
            you may never want to <span class="secretlink" data-secret="secret1">leave.</span>

            In 1943 two brothers, Ricardo and Javier Castro, inherited a small plot of undeveloped
            land just off Wending Flats’ main drag. They decided to use this windfall to build the
            restaurant they had always talked about running together as children. The brother’s built
            the entire Desert Flower Cafe themselves, pouring their blood and {% if rand > 0.4 %} sweat {% elif rand > 0.1 %} bones {% else %} salt {% endif %} into its
            construction. Since its opening in 1945, their delicious food has been a favorite of
            locals and tourists alike, making the Desert Flower a perfect spot for birthdays,
            bachelor parties, or a romantic date night! While Javier and Ricardo turned the restaurant
            over to their respective daughters in 1987, the fruits of their original construction
            have remained largely untouched.

            Dennice Solomon, often called the queen of pies, opened her own diner in 1972. It was
            originally called Dennice's, until a freak lighting storm knocked donwn the 'C'. We've
            all gotten so used to calling it Dennie's, it's hard to believe it ever had a different
            name!
