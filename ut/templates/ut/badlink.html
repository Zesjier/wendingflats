            5. I have seen many residents head west toward Elko.
            None ever travel east. No local has ever been to Salt Lake City.
            Each of them has a lot to say about it.

            2. The mechanic has a picture of a man who looks just like him on his wall. His father,
            according to him. I met him again yesterday. He introduced himself as the mechanicâ€™s
            son. The same man walked through the door of the cafe. The first one, the one I was
            talking to, waved him over and introduced him as his brother. They both ordered
            their coffee black.
